# MinChartKit
ðŸ“ˆ Easily Create Hyper-Minimal Charts ðŸ“Š

## Usage
All charts are created throught the ``MinChartKit`` ``struct``, by first injecting the data:

```swift
let data = [1.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,...]
let minChartKit = MinChartKit(data:data)
```

Then calling the type of chart you want to make with the data and passing that chart as a parameter:

```swift
...
let minLine = (pull from storyboard)
minChartKit.line(minLine)
```

As noted above, the ``MinLine`` or ``MinBar`` charts can be used in your storyboard and connected through an ``@IBOutlet``.


You can also inject a color for your chart on instantiation of the ``MinChartKit`` ``struct``:

```swift
...
let minChartKit = MinChartKit(data:data, color:.blue)
minChartKit.bar(minBar)
```

## On the Sholders...
*MinChartKit* is built on top of [*``Charts``*](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts), and therefore the min charts have access to the parent classes methods and parameters:

```swift
// animate drawing of a line
minLine.animate(xAxisDuration: 1.682)
```

This also allows the ability to fully customize the ``MinLine`` chart in any way you would customize the  ``LineChartView`` class.  Take a look at the [*``Charts``*](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) docs for more details.
